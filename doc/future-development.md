This document outlines the roadmap and future development plans for Wyseman.

## Current Development Focus

The current development priority is to implement a libp2p interface as an alternative to the current WebSocket interface.

## Planned Features

### Short-term Goals (Next 6-12 months)

- **libp2p Interface**: Implement a libp2p-based connection protocol to enhance peer-to-peer capabilities and security.

### Medium-term Goals (1-2 years)

- **Enhanced Migration System**: Improve the schema migration system to support arbitrary SQL alter commands, providing more flexibility for schema evolution.

### Long-term Vision

- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Potential integration with other schema management tools, allowing users to author in TCL but leverage other migration mechanisms.

## Enhancement Proposals

### Schema Management Improvements

- Extend migration capabilities to handle more complex table alterations
- Research integration possibilities with established schema management tools
- Develop more robust schema validation and error checking

## Community Contributions

Areas where community contributions would be particularly welcome:

- Improvements to the schema migration system
- Documentation and examples
- Cross-platform testing
- Integration with common development frameworks
