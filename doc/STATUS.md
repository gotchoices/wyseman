# Wyseman Documentation Status

This file tracks the progress of the Wyseman documentation project. It serves as a planning and tracking tool for documenting each aspect of the system.

## Overall Progress

- [x] Documentation structure established
- [x] DOCS.md planning document created
- [x] README.md (TOC) created
- [x] Several individual section files created with outlines
- [x] Complete first draft of all sections (14/14 completed)
- [x] Review of all sections complete (14/14 completed)
- [x] Information migration from old documentation verified
- [ ] Final release of documentation

The documentation is now ready for final review and release. All planned sections have been completed, reviewed, and verified to include all relevant information from the previous documentation.

## Documentation Migration Tasks

- [x] Draft new main README.md for project root (GitHub landing page)
- [x] Create doc/old/ directory
- [x] Move existing old documentation to doc/old/
  - [x] Original
  - [x] Control
