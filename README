Wyseman is a database schema manager, part of the WyattERP application 
framework.

It is used for authoring and managing database schemas in PostgreSQL.  It 
also provides run-time access to the data dictionary for databases it manages.

Wyseman was originally implemented entirely in Tcl/Tk.  More recently,
the command line app was ported to ruby.  However, the configuration
code (i.e. the way you describe your database schema) remains in Tcl, which 
is a good fit for the long term.

The run-time code has been partially ported to ruby--at least enough to
work for basic purposes.  More work could be done here as demand arises.

Also a Javascript run-time has been created to act as a server end for Wylib
applications running in the browser.

See README.orig for more on the original project description.
See README.pg for notes on installing/interfacing with PostgreSQL.

For now, you may have to consult the source code for command line options
for the ruby script.

This code has been ported primarily for the purpose of supporting the
MyCHIPs project (github.com/gotchoices/mychips).  So improvements are mostly
being added responsive to those needs.  If you would like to use wyseman and
need other features/fixes, please contact the author (particularly if you 
are willing to help).
