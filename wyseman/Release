4	Release 4 (numbered 0.40)
        Changed to allow objects to be created in postgres namespaces
        (schemas).  Many changes were made to the wyseman system catalog
        tables and columns.  The interface for user programs should have
        remained largely the same.

        Many bug fixes, many feature additions

2	Release 2	
	This release is updated for use with Postgres 8.1.0 which changed
	fundamentally the way users and groups exist in the database.
	Users and groups (roles) are now stored in the same table (pg_roles).
	This shouldn't be a problem (as long as you avoid a username that
	could be mistaken for a valid group name).
	
	Postgres also changed the way sequences work.  Typically you might
	create a sequence and a table in association with each other.  Some
	field in the table will draw values from the sequence in order to
	populate itself.  Previously, wylib expected you to declare the 
	sequence as being dependent upon the table (since it was then 
	possible to create a table which referenced a non-existent sequence).
	Then, we would populate the "create" field of the object with code
	that would also initialize the sequence to a good number (like the
	max value of the field that uses it).  That way, you would build
	the table, re-populate it with data, and then call the sequence
	creation code to get it initialized to a value appropriate to the
	pre-existing data in the table.

	This is no longer possible, so you must now declare the table to
	be dependent upon the sequence (so the sequences get built first).
	Then, after restoring data to the table, execute a script that will
	initialize the sequences to their proper values.  This is shown in
	the sample schema as "make sequence".
