Dependencies:

Postgres:  See README.pg
  Must have running postgresql server.  Run initdb as postgres user and
  create a user with the name of the user that will run the MyCHIPs server
  (mychips).

Ruby postgresql plugin
  gem install ruby-pg		;or
  dnf install rubygem-pg
  
ruby-tcltk
  gem install tcltklib		;or
  dnf install ruby-tcltk

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wyseman includes an executable that can be run in a variety of modes
to help you build and maintain a PostgreSQL database schema.

For running the executable, you need to make sure it is installed 
somewhere in your PATH.  The Makefile will install in /usr/local/bin by 
default.  You can set the environment variable WYBIN to something else 
and the Makefile should pick that up.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Additionally, wyseman includes a run-time loadable Tcl library that can be
included by a Tcl application to access the database's data dictionary.

To access the Tcl library, it must be installed in a directory that is part
of your TCLLIBPATH variable (usually defaults to /usr/lib or /usr/share).

If you run (as root)

    "make install" 
    
in the current directory, it should install the executable in 
/usr/local/bin and the run-time library under /usr/lib.  If you set the
environment variable WYLIB to some directory, the run-tine library will
be installed there.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Optionally, wyseman can also create a run-time loadable Tcl library that
provides default view information (like how to display the fields of
a table in a multi-editing widget).

This library can be built using the "make lib" option (as long as you 
have properly authored .wmd files in your schema directory).

See the description for .wmd files in the README for more information.
