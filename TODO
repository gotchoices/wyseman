Wyseman TODO
X- Test orphan.js:
X- Objects' max_rel end up at correct number
X- Loader loads release table, then objects
X- Can delete DB and build again from schema files with history getting properly created in DB
X- Can remove "mod_ver" field from wm.objects
X- On first run, wyseman creates working release if it doesn't already exist
X- Can remove "source" field from wm.objects now?
X- How to prune removed objects (maybe just manually?)
X- Store bootstrap, dictionary, init for each release in history file
X- Schema file pulls actual release number and date from history/db
X- Schema files get built with valid initialization info every time
X- Schema pulls archival info from committed release history if it exists
