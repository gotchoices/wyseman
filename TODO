Wyseman TODO
X- Get old regression tests working again
- 
X- When I create schema, does it do the last stable or next beta?
X- Create last committed, by default (or override)
X- Create versioned schema files as we go through the testing
- 
- Test orphan.js:
- Loader loads release table, then objects
- Objects' max_rel end up at correct number
- 
- Can delete DB and build again from schema files with history getting properly created in DB
- Can remove "source" field from wm.objects now?
-   How to prune removed objects (maybe just manually?)
- Can remove "mod_ver" field from wm.objects
-   
- Schema file pulls actual release number and date from history/db
- Also store bootstrap, dictionary, init for each release in history file
- Can reproduce/instantiate schema for any specified release
-   
- Can test/re-test complete migration from one release to the next
-   Include module for an application to test its own migrations
- Run-time library automatically (or on demand) updates to latest schema version
- 
- Remove Ruby legacy wyseman files
