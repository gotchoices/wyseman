Wyseman TODO
X- Implement (sql and wyseman CLI) command for committing/locking a schema release
X-  Wyseman maintains Wyseman.hist file(s)	(or: .sourceFile.wmh)
X-   Can update the version information in Wyseman.hist
X-   How/when do I update wm.releases?
X-   How does this affect objects already in wm.objects?
X-   How/when do I load old objects from Wyseman.hist into the DB?
X-   How/when do I update history list in Wyseman.hist?
X- wm.commit() needs to update objects.max_rel = next()
X- Try modifying an object with next() = 2
X- wm.migrate needs to ascertain its own dirty status
X- Setup regression test suite for new features
X- Wyseman checks/loads history/releases every run
