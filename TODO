Wyseman TODO
X- Wyseman init not filling in country table
X- Include bootstrap in schema build SQL?
X- Database built from Sql runs immediately under wyseman (not after 2nd try)
- 
- Make module to accept/edit/process migration deltas
- Can input deltas from command line (writes to wmg file)
- Can edit wmg file directly
- Wait for actual migrations to test on mychips schema
- 
- Can produce schema file for any specified version?
- Add delta column to wm.objects table
- Add hash column to wm.objects table
- Make JSON (writable) view over wm.objects
- Wyseman maintains Wyseman.delta file(s)	(or: .sourceFile.wmm)
- Wyseman maintains Wyseman.hist file(s)	(or: .sourceFile.wmh)
- 
- Make runtime handler to (also) use new schema file format
-  Can produce a straight sql file from the necessary parts (for new DB)
-  Can produce Sql to populate wm.objects and instantiate schema from there
-  Can produce delta script from any version to any other
- 
- Plgsql make routine applies deltas from last committed table form
- 
- Implement (sql and wyseman CLI) command for committing/locking a schema version
- Switch over to new wyseman for mainstream development
- Start committing schema versions in mychips
- 
- 
- OLD:
?- Separate run-time scripts to separate wyclif module (Control Layer InterFace)
- Implement/store table modification microscripts where drop/create won't do
-  When a table column is removed or renamed, the old data won't import (have to manually rename first)
-  When a new constraint is added, the old data may not fit anymore.  May have to filter it.
-  When an object is removed from the schema, items in the db may still be dependent on it and drops may not work without a cascade
- Test/validate schema release versioning features
- Tie single digit release number to associated semver release ID?
- Finish porting ruby run-time
- 
- Versioning:
- Can I get rid of release function and releases table?
- get rid of object.source.  Let the user prune anything that doesn't show up
- get rid of object.mod_ver
- get rid of object.module? (do we care or is the schema really the thing?)
- do I need objects_v?
- rename depends_v?
