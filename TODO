Wyseman TODO
X- Test orphan.js:
X- Objects' max_rel end up at correct number
X- Loader loads release table, then objects
X- Can delete DB and build again from schema files with history getting properly created in DB
X- Can remove "mod_ver" field from wm.objects
-  On first run, wyseman creates working release if it doesn't already exist
-   
- Can remove "source" field from wm.objects now?
-   How to prune removed objects (maybe just manually?)
-   
- Schema pulls archival info from committed release history if it exists
- Schema files get built with valid initialization info every time
- Can reproduce/instantiate schema for any specified release
- 
- Schema file pulls actual release number and date from history/db
- Also store bootstrap, dictionary, init for each release in history file
-   
- Can test/re-test complete migration from one release to the next
-   Include module for an application to test its own migrations
- Run-time library automatically (or on demand) updates to latest schema version
- 
- Remove Ruby legacy wyseman files
-
