Legacy TCL sample applications

This sample schema definition is for use with the sample employee database 
application and shared calendar application.

To run the sample applications, do the following:
  
  Make sure Wylib is installed 		(see INSTALL in wylib source dir)
  Make sure Wyseman is installed	(see INSTALL in wyseman source dir)
  Make sure PostgreSQL is installed	(see PostgreSQL documentation)
  Make sure libpgtcl is installed	(the Tcl API to access PostgreSQL)

  In the schema directory do:

(as dbadmin user)
    dropdb wyatt		#only if it already exists
    make build			#build database from schema
    make text			#install language definitions in database
    make lib			#make default run-time library

(as dbadmin user)
  Run the kickstart script in the wylib source dir to install first user    
  
(as first user)
  Run the "events" script to see a simple calendar application

  Run the "emplim" script to add new employees to your enterprise.
  You can grant privileges to users with the option in the Tools menu.

  The "eim" program is an employee directory showing only limited 
  information so it is suitable for use by all users.
